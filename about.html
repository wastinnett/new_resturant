        <h1> The Wild Italian Story</h1>
        <p>
          What started out as a premiere food truck in downtown Lexington, soon became a traditional brick and mortar with a twist. Keeping the food truck alive, customers can stop by the Truck to grab a custom pizza. The Wild Italian Chef and Owner, Adam Stinnett, did not want to stray completely away from what brought on this success. The Truck still travels through the city to attend events for non-profits and charities. The brick and mortar soon became the next step in the Wild success plan and continues to help grow the brand today.
